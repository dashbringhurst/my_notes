This is a repository for my notes.

Okay, here we go:

- Git and Github are two separate things.
- Create a new repository first in Github, then git clone the repository into the codeup-data-science directory ~ (copy SSH from Github and paste after git clone)
- Add, commit, push
- git status to see the status of current files in repository
- Git push every day.
- Git push every day.
- update profile readme periodically. Add cool stuff.
- adding files to .gitignore keeps them from being pushed to Github
- don't nest repositories; keep each repository in its own directory

SQL 7/1/22

CRUD: create, retrieve, update, delete

SQL and MySQL are different...
- RDBMS : software that you run to access the data
- database : actual location on the disk where data exists
- database server : machine holding the data
- database client : program used to connect to and query the database
- DDL : data definition language; commands to change RDBMS or structure of database
- DML : database manipulation language; used to CRUD information from the database (what we will focus on in course)
