This is a repository for my notes.

Okay, here we go:

- Git and Github are two separate things.
- Create a new repository first in Github, then git clone the repository into the codeup-data-science directory ~ (copy SSH from Github and paste after git clone)
- Add, commit, push
- git status to see the status of current files in repository
- Git push every day.
- Git push every day.
- update profile readme periodically. Add cool stuff.
- adding files to .gitignore keeps them from being pushed to Github
- don't nest repositories; keep each repository in its own directory
